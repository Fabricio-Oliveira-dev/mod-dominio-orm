# Domain Model and ORM
This project is an exercise from the DevSuperior school, which is a programming school that helps students to become professional Java developers following good practices

### Feature
A domain model is implemented with four entities (Participant, Activity, Category and Block). It is desired to build a system to manage the information of the participants in the activities of a
academic event. The activities of this event can be, for example, lectures, courses, workshops, etc. Each activity that takes place has a name, description, price and can be divided into several
blocks of time (for example, an HTML course can take place in two blocks; it is necessary to store the day and block start and end times for that day). For each participant, the goal is to register their name and email.
